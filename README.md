## Tracking watched films

A program that will store films you watched. You can store the title of the film, original title if the film is released
abroad, release year, your personal rating for the film, a date when you watched the film and personal comments about
the film.

This program can read from properly formatted csv file and keep stored data in that file by updating it, or store the
same data in SQLite database.
